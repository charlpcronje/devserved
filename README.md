# devserved

This is a small Node.js game to display some of the things Node can do in the cmdLine.

Run, clone the repo (No need to run npm install or yarn or anything, I accidently commited al the dependiencies as well.

So just clone and run

```shell
yarn serve
# 
npn run 
```

Cool, have fun!!
